# Sushi Saga

Welcome to Sushi Saga, where your journey to sushi is only just beginning!

We've had a bit of trouble with our patented Sushi Saga conveyor belt system, so
before you can eat, you're going to have to help us get it working.

## Setup

All the sushi data about can be found in the `db.json` file. We'll be using
`json-server` to create a RESTful API for our database.

Run `npm install` to install our dependencies.

Then, run `npm run server` to start up `json-server` on `http://localhost:3001`.

In another tab, run `npm start` to start up our React app at
`http://localhost:3000`.
